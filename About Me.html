    <h2>My History</h2><br>
    <section> 
    <div> <p>Hi i'm Cole, a 15 year old second degree black-belt in Shotokan karate, I have been practiceing this form of karate for <br>7 years now
      and I know how hard it is to get the infomation to learn it. ofcorse I didn't learn karate from screen that would be rediculis.<br><br>
      Unlike others I quickly went up the rank, as a student as I am a quick learner although the years were hard they have given me skills I wouldn't have learnt anywhere else<br>
    like discipline, dedication and patience. <br><br> karate is easy to learn if you want it bad enough but there is alway a salution to not getting hurt in 
    a fight, you can always just run away<br> that is the one thing you are always told in the dojo, Just strike them once an run espesaly if your in a street fight it doesn't matter if you look like a cowered just keep your self safe.<br>
  on that note don't learn this and get in a bunch of fight for no reason. I created this website to keep people safe, so only fight if you or anyone that's inocent is in danger.  </p><br>
